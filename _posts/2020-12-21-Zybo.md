Hello Math: $ \mathcal{D}\_{p} = \left\langle \left\\{ \cfrac{\partial}{\partial x_i} \right\\}\_{ i \in \\{1,\ldots,n\\}} \right\rangle $

## Important! 

1. Find a reliable tutorial. (The official is NOT necessarily reliable.)
1. Follow **EXACTLY** what he does.
1. Refrain from updates and any types of recent releases.
(Older is always better in the embedded world.)

## Yocto

`Yocto` is a linux building tool for almost any hardware.

### TODO
~~~
- Customize the meta-zybo layer to meet the most recent version of yocto
~~~

### Tutorial

- Everything must be done on an Ubuntu laptop. (I have done with 18.04 LTS.)
- The build process consumes a huge amount of time and disk. Recommend to use AWS.
- [Reference 1](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.2.1/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html)
(Official tutorial from the yocto project docs)
- [Reference 2](https://emcongiu.wordpress.com/?_ga=2.172961699.1066187344.1608558104-597882170.1608469260)
(Famous tutorial for the Zybo board, though a bit obsolete. Do not use the zybo
layer from this page.)
- [Video Introduction](https://vimeo.com/36450321) (About half an hour)
- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMCfn0zwhaQ)

1. Clone `pocky` from the git and checkout to the branch `rokco`. (Match the
   branch with the latest supported one by Xilinx.)
1. Clone `meta-xilinx`. (Checkout to `rokco`.)
1. Build a minimal linux after changing `local.conf` (Change the device to
   `zybo-zynq7`.) and `bblayer.conf` (Add the `meta-xilinx-bsp` layer.). 
1. Follow the youtube video for booting. Copy five files to the booting partition
   and extracted root system on the second partition.

## Vivado and Vitis

- Make sure to follow this [arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xilinx_Vivado), and do not miss to install any additional packages like `xorg-xlsclients`.

## Serial Communication

- Follow [this
  guide](https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/getting-started-with-ipi/v2019.2)
  for the first hello world program.
- Use `sudo cu -l DEVICE -s BUD_RATE` to connect with the board via UART.
- `cu` command is in `uucp` package.
- The port information is on `dmesg | grep tty`. (ttyUSB1 for the test case)
